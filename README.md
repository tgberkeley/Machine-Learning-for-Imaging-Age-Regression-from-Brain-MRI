## Machine Learning for Imaging Coursework Imperial College 2020/2021

Predicting the age of a patient from their brain MRI scan can have diagnostic value for a number of diseases 
that may cause structural changes and potential damage to the brain. A discrepancy between the predicted age and the real, 
chronological age of a patient might indicate the presence of disease. This requires an accurate predictor of brain age 
which may be learned from a set of healthy reference subjects, given their brain MRI data and their actual age.

**The objective for the coursework is to implement two supervised learning approaches for age regression from brain MRI.** 
We provide data from a total of 652 healthy subjects, that is split into different development sets and a hold-out test 
set on which you will evaluate your final prediction accuracy.
